# Test requirements

This test is to show React component creation and usage of data state storage and data manipulation.

## Requirements

- In the app, create a component which contains a text input and submit button.

- When text is entered into the input, clicking the submit button should add the text to a list displayed under the text input.

- Each time text is entered and the submit button is clicked, it should add the text to a list, creating a list of multiple text items.

- When clicking on an item in the list, that item should be removed from the list.

- Above the text input should be a counter detailing how many items are in the list.

- Finally, please explain how you would test the component.
